# codeGen
In script.js I first created an object of characters for my functions to use later on in the code to loop through and choose from. I also created two variables, password and newpassword, and set them both to empty strings. I then prompt the user for an input length to know how many characters the password will contain by looping through the array of characters for the "length" amount of times, that will be saved into my newpassword variable. I created while loops to make sure certain standards are held true for the length and for the confirm questions as well. Everthing is added into another object to make calling upon the values more simple and orgainized. In a series of if statements within a function I am adding into the newpassword variable the characters the users wants depending upon whether the confirms are true and returning that newpassword as a string of characters. In the generatePassword function I am looping through the string of newpassword characters, "length amount of times" and randomizing the characters and adding them variable password to return back to the user. Finially it is displayed to the user after the generate password button is clicked thus disabling the button once the text area is not longer equal to an empty string.
